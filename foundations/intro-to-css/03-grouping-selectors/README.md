# Grouping Selectors

Let's build a little off the previous exercise. Here, you're going to give two elements each a unique class name, then add rules for styles that both elements share as well as their own unique styles. Make sure you take a good look at the outcome image below to see exactly what is unique about each element, and what both elements have in common.

This will help you further practice adding classes and using class selectors, so be sure you add the class attribute in the HTML file. For the remainder of these exercises, the format of any colors is entirely up to you; we trust you'll practice using the different values! The properties you need to add to each element are:

- **The first element**: a black background and white text [completed]
- **The second element**: a yellow background [completed]
- **Both elements**: a font size of 28px and a list of fonts containing `Helvetica` and `Times New Roman`, with `sans-serif` as a fallback [working]

## Desired Outcome

### Self Check

- Does each element have a unique class name?
- Did you use the grouping selector for styles that both elements share?
- Did you make separate rules for the styles unique to each element?

### Working through the problem ---
1. Criteria 1 - The first element: a black background and white text
[x] Read instructions
[x] read the first element criteria
[x] look at the examplle product
[x] Identify the first element - use comments to identify the first element
[x] give the first element a class selector
[x] identify second element and give it a class selector name

- Now that we did our part in settitng up the html - we will work on the css criterie:
[x] give black background to first element
[x] give white text to first element

[xx] First criteria done

2. Criteria 2 - The second element: a yellow background
[] give second element a yellow background
[] gave second element a class selector already in step 1

[xx] Second criteria done


3. Criteria 3 - Both Elements - Grouping selectors :
**Both elements**: a font size of 28px and a list of fonts containing `Helvetica` and `Times New Roman`, with `sans-serif` as a fallback [working]
