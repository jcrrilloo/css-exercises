# Class and ID Selectors
Knowing how to add class and ID attributes to HTML elements, as well as use their respective selectors, is invaluable. It's important to practice using them.

There are several elements in the HTML file provided, which you will have to add either class or ID attributes to, as noted in the outcome image below. You will then have to add rules in the CSS file provided using the correct selector syntax. Look over the outcome image carefully, and try to keep in mind which elements look similarly styled (classes), which ones may be completely unique from the rest (ID), and which ones have slight variations from others (multiple classes).

It isn't entirely important which class or ID values you use, as the focus here is on being able to add the attributes and use the correct selector syntax to style elements. For the colors in this exercise, try using a non-keyword value (RGB, HEX, or HSL). The properties you need to add to each element are:

* **All odd numbered elements**: a light red/pink background, and a list of fonts containing `Verdana` and `DejaVu Sans` with `sans-serif` as a fallback
* **The second element**: blue text and a font size of 36px
* **The third element**: in addition to the styles for all odd numbered elements, add a font size of 24px
* **The fourth element**: a light green background, a font size of 24px, and bold

Quick tip: in VS Code, you can change which format colors are displayed in RGB, HEX, or HSL by hovering over the color value in the CSS and clicking the top of the popup that appears!

> ### Note:
> Part of your task is to add a font to _some_ of these items. Your browser's font's might be different than the one displayed in the desired outcome image. As long as you confirm that the fonts _are_ being applied to the right lines any differences are okay for this exercise.

## Desired Outcome

### Self Check
- Do the odd numbered `p` elements share a class?
- Do the even numbered `div` elements have unique IDs?
- Does the Number 3 element have multiple classes?

### Working through the problem
- Let's start with what we know:
* We will have ID and Class selectors
- Let's identify those first with the correct tags/syntax
[x]Completed

secondly:
- odd numbered elements need:
1. light/red pink background
2. llist of fonts containing 'Verdana' andd 'Dejavu Sans' with 'sans-serif as a fallback
3. a quick note in the brief: "
For the colors in this exercise, try using a non-keyword value (RGB, HEX, or HSL) "

* let's add step '1' to the odd numbered elements and identify those
[x] completed and identyified using comments within the .html file
[x] named my id's and classes in html


* let's add the fonts containing the correct fonts and the sans-serif as a fallback
note: grouping classes ?  can  they have all the same class naming convention, could it be different and can we group them ? ** refer back to notes
* Outcome: Yes, this is called 'grouping selectors'
[x] grouped odd numbered selectors so that they can contrrain the correct fonts and fallback font

Now,  let's walk through the second element criteria:
* **The second element**: blue text and a font size of 36px
[x] Identify the second element - does it have an ID, Yes. is it an even element, yes

Now, let's walk through the third element criteria
[x]* **The third element**: in addition to the styles for all odd numbered elements, add a font size of 24px

Now, let's walk  through the fourtht and final criteria
[] * **The fourth element**: a light green background, a font size of 24px, and bold
